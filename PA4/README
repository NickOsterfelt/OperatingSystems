---Folders---
/Results - Folder to store the results described in PA4WriteUp.pdf
/data - Folder to contain the output of running ./testscript

---Executables---
./testscript2 - A simple bash script for running fifty-four test vectors 
	        and outputting results to appropriately named files in /data.
./cpu-bound - A simple program to statistically calculate pi over one million 
	      iterations using a specified scheduling policy, number of
	      simultaneous processes and distinction of same/different priority.
./io-bound - A Simple program to read from an input file and write to an output file
             using a specified scheduling policy, number of simultaneous processes 
             and distinction of same/different priority.
./mixed - A simple program to calculate pi over one hundred thousand iterations
	  and perform an I/O read and write operation at every one thousandth 
          iteration using a specified scheduling policy, number of simultaneous processes 
          and distinction of same/different priority. 

---Examples---

io-bound:
 ./io-bound
 ./io-bound <Scheduling Policy> <Number Simultaneous Processes> <Same/Diff priority>

mixed:
 ./mixed
 ./mixed <Scheduling Policy> <Number Simultaneous Processes> <Same/Diff priority>
